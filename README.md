# Platformer Sandbox

This is basically a clone of Terraria done in C that I made to practice programming, game development and because it seemed like a fun and pretty customizable idea. Though it has to be said that my vision for this game is to be quite different besides the core mechanics.

Currently you can move a dirt tile - a player placeholder. You can move in any direction using either WASD or arrows. You can also scroll to zoom. There are 2 tiles as a preview of the grid.

I resolved most issues, but the movement is jittery and I will fix that later. I hope to add more features soon.

## How to compile

- you need to have Cmake installed
- create a build directory - `mkdir build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`
- `./PlatformerSandbox`
